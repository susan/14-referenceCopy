    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const copyPlayers = [...players]
    const copyPlayers2 = players.slice()
    const copyPlayers3 = [].concat(players)

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
          twitter: "yes",
          facebook: "no"
      }
    };
    const copyPerson = {...person}
    person.social.twitter= "no"
    console.log("person is", person)
    console.log("copyPerson is", copyPerson)
    //blank obj, second arg is obj you want to copy, third is new stuff overwrite
    const copy2Person = Object.assign({}, person, {newProp: "zzzz", age: 90})
    
    //way to deep clone , there is also deep clone method
    const copy3Person = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
    //console.log(copy2Person)
    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
